# Texteditor
In our first mandatory assigment for IS-211. We also recieved a number of sub-tasks, or requirements to meet. In the README me will note the things we have started on,
completed and other valuable information.

## Sub-tasks to do:
- Choose a fitting data structure and implement it.
- Insert regular characters
- Make -zæø ̊a, A-ZÆØ ̊A, 0-9, and separators (,.;:!) printable characters.
- Delete characters
- Linebreaking
- Display cursor

## Progress so far:
- Data structure has been choosen, and implemented.
- Inserting characters fully functioning.
- Line break implemented.

## Bugs:
- When reaching the last possible character in the LinkedList. It only changes the cursor position. This will be fixed when implementing "Delete" function.
